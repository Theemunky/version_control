    I thought that my forked repo would automatically be updated with the content of your origin repo. This is not the case.
    My fork only showed my latest contributions. I had to perform a pull request from yours to mine.

    One thing I found interesting is I pulled your dev branch into my master. SO, this tells us we have the option of choosing which of our branches
    we want to merge regardless of mat
    ching names.
    What I should have done was created a branch in my own repo called dev. Then I could have pulled your dev branch to
    my dev branch. But because my repo still only had master, I chose it to and pulled your dev branch to it.


    This makes sense though, because it allows us personal control over our own updates.. and when we are comfortable with
    it we submit pull requests. For example this request is going to be saying "pull gainey/master to mullins/dev" ..
    Then when you are confident that the dev branch is compatible. merge master into dev.. again check that dev is
    working to your liking. If so THEN merge dev into master.

    This is the important for us to know - we should never just merge updates into a "live" program (in our example the master branch)
    and the reason is we want to make sure that merging them is smooth. For example what if we had a program out for a customer
    and we were working on an update and we pushed the update live. (we merged the dev to the master) and it crashes!! ahh!
    Good practice is testing the merges together first on the dev branch -> hence we merge master TO dev.. verify no issues
    Then we merge dev back to master.

    I also was able to see your updates in the commit history! perfect bro!!
